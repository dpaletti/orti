# Code of Conduct

**All creatures are welcome**: we aim to create a safe space for all community members,
regardless of their age, race, gender, sexual orientation, physical appearance or
disability, choice of text editor, or any other qualities by which living beings can be
discriminated.

**Be excellent to each other**: we do not tolerate verbal or physical harassment,
violence or intimidation.

We do not tolerate life forms who refuse to share this openness and respect towards
others: creatures that are not excellent to others are not welcome.

We continuously strive to make our community a better place for everyone in the best
tradition of hackers we "build, test, improve, reiterate". In this ongoing adventure, we
rely on the support, courage, and creativity of all members of the community.

If you are made uncomfortable in your role as community member, please let us know: you
can reach us at [danielepaletti98@gmail.com](danielepaletti98@gmil.com). All complaints
will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that is deemed necessary
and appropriate to the circumstances. The project team is obligated to maintain
confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident.
