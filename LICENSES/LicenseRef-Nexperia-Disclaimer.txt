Nexperia' products are specifically designed and manufactured to be used within the electrical, thermal, mechanical and other parameters set forth in Nexperia' data sheets. Quality and reliability data provided by Nexperia, such as MTBF, MSL and FIT, is intended to be a non-binding estimate of product performance based upon diffusion process, history only. It does not imply that any performance levels reflected in such data can be met if the product is operated outside the conditions expressly stated in the latest published data sheet for a device or in your application.

The RoHS data provided hereunder is preliminary and non binding for Nexperia. Nexperia does not accept any liability related to this data.

Nexperia products are not designed, authorized or warranted to be suitable for use in medical, military, aircraft, space or life support equipment, nor in applications where failure or malfunction of an Nexperia product can reasonably be expected to result in personal injury, death or severe property or environmental damage nor for any other use that is not explicitly agreed between the parties. Nexperia accepts no liability for inclusion and/or use of Nexperia products in such equipment or applications and therefore such inclusion and/or use is at the customer's own risk.

Any use of Nexperia' products beyond the scope defined in the current Nexperia' data sheet voids all warranty responsibility of Nexperia with respect to such devices, and also voids all responsibility of Nexperia with respect to any applications assistance, product design, software performance or services of any kind that were or may have been performed in connection with the sale of any such devices.

Further, resale of Nexperia' products or services with statements different from or beyond the parameters stated by Nexperia for that product in official Nexperia data sheets, or without the warnings or instructions provided by Nexperia, voids all express and any implied warranties for the associated Nexperia product or service, and is an unfair and deceptive business practice.
