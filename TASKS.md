# Roadmap

## PCB development

- [x] block diagram

⟶ [completed diagram](hardware/docs/block_diagram.png)

### Simulation

- [x] identify lower bound on stage gain:

⟶ [circuit analysis](hardware/docs/differential_ring_oscillator_analysis.md)

- [ ] get reliable oscillation

⟶ **ongoing in the simulation branch**

- [ ] replace ideal current source
- [ ] include battery voltage source
- [ ] include USB-C recharging

### Open source setup

- [ ] move DCO to more structured CONTRIBUTING.MD and finish setting up the signing
      mechanism understand if GPG signing is needed or only the normal kind
- [ ] add code of conduct on the basis of that from DuckDB (which is from another
      entity)
- [] correctly protect the branches

## Firmware development

## Encasing design

## Mobile app development

## Packaging

## Testing with early adopters
