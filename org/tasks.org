#+title: Tasks

* TODO PCB development [1/3]
** DONE Schematic development [1/1]
*** DONE Define the design of the ring oscillator
Read this [[https://analogcircuitdesign.com/ring-oscillator/][article]] and understand the final design of the oscillator, it should not be VCO, the frequency must change.
Read this [[https://www.seas.ucla.edu/brweb/papers/Journals/BR_SSCM_4_2019.pdf][paper]] for a through explanation on why we should use a differential oscillator.

The idea is that you use the two lines going through the soil that form some sort of a capacitor between them and the soil.
At that point you have a capacitor whose transmission speed influences oscillator frequency and thus by measuring one of the two outputs you can convert it to soil moisture. The differential setup removes temperature and power common-mode noise so that the measurement can be more accurate.

** TODO Simulation [1/4]
**** DONE Identify stages gain
**** STRT Find parameter values range with ideal current source
**** STRT Model current with current mirror
**** TODO Model voltage with battery and USB-C+Voltage regulator
** PROJ Kicad implementation [0/1]
[[https://www.build-electronic-circuits.com/kicad-tutorial/][kicad tutorial]]
Move the simulated circuit to kicad
**** IDEA Copper pours
Evaluate using copper pours and the like (look for more info on it) to avoid creating a 4 layer PCB with 2 layers one for ground and one for supply. Try and create *2-layer PCB* which costs as much as a 1-layer PCB
* PROJ Electronics and PCB design study [1/2]
** DONE Electronics [4/4]
CLOSED: [2025-06-28 sab 13:28]
*** DONE following transistor 101
As of now I am following Transistor 101:
[[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOkxbKLFOCg&list=PLmAbPOh-itGLUXFpPDn6dARGbmldYlKp1][yt playlist from transistor to differential amplifier]]
*** DONE Following transistors on electronics for inventors
[[./resources/electronics_inventors.pdf]]

*** DONE Studying differential amplifier
Here there is an interesting design with JFET and JFET current source:
https://instrumentationlab.berkeley.edu/Lab5
*** DONE Study lcamtuf electronics curriculum for beginners
https://lcamtuf.coredump.cx/offsite.shtml
And read all the articles that appear interesting.
**** DONE Read decoupling capacitors
https://lcamtuf.substack.com/p/the-basics-of-decoupling-capacitorus
To be put inside [[Signal distortions]]
**** DONE Read Signal reflection in electronic circuits
[[https://lcamtuf.substack.com/p/signal-reflections-in-electronic]]
**** DONE Finish the curriculum and check if there is something else of interest on the blog
CLOSED: [2025-06-28 sab 13:27]
In particular finish the interesting part of the electronics curriculum
https://lcamtuf.substack.com/p/electronics-curriculum
(understand signal amplification)
***** DONE Signal amplification (start from adding push-pull outputs)
***** DONE Analog signal filtering, understand RC filters and the rest quite fast
CLOSED: [2025-06-28 sab 11:30]
start from a closer look at the singularity from the second part of filtering

** PROJ The Art of PCB Design [1/3]
*** DONE Component selection guide
*** HOLD Lessons [2/3]
**** DONE Lesson 1
**** DONE Lesson 2
**** HOLD Lesson 3
*** HOLD Labs [2/3]
**** DONE Lab 1
**** DONE Lab 2
**** HOLD Lab 3
* PROJ Firmware development [0/0]
Develop nrf52840 firmware with C.

*bluetooth open source stack for nordic*:
https://github.com/apache/mynewt-nimble
This is part of a full-fledged OS that is overkill for our use case, we will do most of the stuff in app

* PROJ Software development [0/0]
*2 native mobile apps*:
1. Android app with Kotlin + Jetpack compose with [[https://m3.material.io/blog/building-with-m3-expressive][Material UI 3 expressive]]
2. IOs app with Swift + SwiftUI + [[https://developer.apple.com/design/resources/][Apple design]]


*Final outcomes*:
- IOS/Android app for monitoring and sensor-plant pairing
- integration with zigbee, thread, matter and home automation

*Implementation ideas*:
1. use UniFFi to build common backend in Rust: UniFFi supports Kotlin, Swift and Kotlin Multiplaform that would allow to have one unique codebase for Android and IOS, there is also a UI framework to build UIs for Android and IOS in only one place
2. Another alternative is to use *Flutter*, seems most mature
3. Rust has bindings if needed to build cross-platform stuff with GTK (GTK-rs)
* PROJ Encasing design [0/0]
Here a blog post with guidelines for 3d printing:
https://blog.rahix.de/design-for-3d-printing/

A man with a shovel where the shovel houses the temp sensor and from the man departs the humidity sensor.
Maybe the man also has a hat.

* PROJ Website development [0/0]
- static website with branding and product info
- buying section with payments and automatic shipping computation
 TODO Branding
*Make everything revolve around paper cut-out stop-motion animation*
I should have that cut-out aestaethic and the promotional video made with that.
Very cool the idea of moving cut-outs with your hands and having also the hands enter the animation.
[[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1zxsk_wsGs][example]]
* PROJ Product testing with early adopters [0/0]
feedback from friends and shops willing to test the sensor. Maybe even someone or reddit or similar.
* PROJ Packaging development [0/0]
Extremely simple, cheap and sustainable package.
Branding can be done with a 'timbro' (tipo la botte) so that I can buy cheap no logo box and add the stamp myself

* PROJ Advertisement [0/0]
adv campaign to pump interest in the sensor
Cut-out stop-motion animation:
[[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1zxsk_wsGs][example]]
* PROJ First round of sells [0/0]
Start selling a limited amount of products

(?) *Drops with unique designs*: increase margin by making drops with unique design and collaborating with small design studios
